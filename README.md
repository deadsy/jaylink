Go bindings for the libjaylink library.

What Is It?

See: https://gitlab.zapb.de/zapb/libjaylink

libjaylink is a C-based library that provides an API for talking to Segger J-Link devices.

See: https://www.segger.com/products/debug-probes/j-link/

This package provides a wrapper around the library API so you can call it from Go code.
